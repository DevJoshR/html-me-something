         If you have followed the nba within the last 5 years, then you most definitely
          remember just how dominant the <b>Golden State Warriors</b> were. They were a team
           that most fans either loved or hated. You may ask,"Why hated?" What exactly 
           happened to the team that went on to break an all time nba record? Can they ever 
           get back to being as dominant as they were years back?
      </p>

         This team lead by <b>Stephen Curry</b>(&darr;pictured below&darr;), in 2015, went on to win
          their first title in 40 years. As hinted previously, they went on to a 73 and 9 
          win/loss record the following year. While gaining much respect from fans. They 
          showed that true selfless teamwork could accomplish a lot!

         After a questionable loss in the 2016 finals, <b>Golden State</b> made a move that
          some loved and some really hated. They decided to take their 73 win team and trade 
          for <b>Kevin Durant</b>, aka KD (&darr;pictured below&darr;). <kb>KD</kb> is a great player
          who some even consider to be the greatest scorer of all time. 
      </p>

      <p>
         After the acquisition of <b>KD</b>, this team was literally unstoppable.
          Demolished opponents effortlessly. Fans were crying
          everwhere about the unfairness....well not us <b>Golden State</b> fans..we loved 
          every bit of it! 
        <img src="images\warriors2017.jpg" class="blue-stripped"> 
         Well. Thanks to our new acquired talent, the <b>Golden State</b>'s historic run was
          followed by 2 more championship rings. It is also safe to say that many fans unfollowed 
          the NBA because of the "unfairness." I also happen to personally know people who have 
          quit the <b>Nba</b> because of it.

      <p>
         Well. just a few years ago, during their last great season, there was an
          altercation between <b>Golden State</b>'s best player, <b>KD</b>, and Forward, 
          <b>Draymond Green</b>. An altercation that was no more than two fueling egos, that 
          would eventually cause issues to the team from within.
      </p>

      <p>
         With the altercation being a factor in his decision to resign with the <b>Warriors</b>,
          <b>KD</b> decided he would take his great talents elsewhere. And being that Golden State 
          had already traded a handful  of great players to acquire him. <b>KD</b> leaving, left 
          <b>Golden State</b> in a bad position. Which lead to a season so hard to watch. 
          Lets just say, it was one of their worst seasons  by a longshot. It was mindblowing
          watching a 73-9 win team fall to one of the worst teams to date.

         as well get acquanted with a few new additions to their current roster! Will they be enough
         to make the <b>Warriors</b> contenders again?
